Project: Aware Engine

The core ambition of this project is to create a game like Myst III with photo-realistic, pre-rendered, 360 degree panoramic graphics. Interactivity will be accomplished using pre-rendered video overlays. The game engine code will be kept as generic as possible so that it can be reused for other games.
